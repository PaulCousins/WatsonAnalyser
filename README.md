# WatsonAnalyser

Initial investigation work done to process support emails via Watson Sentiment Analyser. Failed; basically the quality of the input emails didn't lend itself to the task as i could meet the requirements for the sentiment analyser (max 50 - 60 words). Using a sentence analyser (i used Apache's NLP) and picking up the first 5 sentences or so looked like it might have some value but ran out of time to get the results plugged into Watson
